      "TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.\n",

      "\n",
      "MADDOW: And with that, that’s it. We’re going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we’re going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.\n",

      "\n",
      "Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, “It’s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.” So please tell us why you think if he’s elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I’ve been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we’re now on the path to achieving it. I don’t want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether it’s the U.K., whether it’s France, whether it’s Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can’t do that.\n",

      "Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? It’s an expensive proposition.\n",

      "I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street’s time to help the middle class.\n",

      "\n",
      "SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.\n",
      "\n",
      "SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we’re waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you’re too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party’s standard bearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I’ve heard Senator Sanders comments, and it’s really caused me to wonder who’s left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don’t think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy’s immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we’ve done and what we will do. That’s why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That’s what I’m offering and that’s what I will do as president.\n",
      "\n",
      "(APPLAUSE)\n",
      "\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?\n",
      "\n",
      "SANDERS: No, not at all. Here’s the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "(APPLAUSE)\n",
      "\n",
      "TODD: I’d like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can’t be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can’t be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?\n",
      "\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been — I’m paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I’m a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.\n",

      "CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I’m a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn’t change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children’s Defense Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: ... I think it’s important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that’s what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let’s not be — in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I’ve always stood.\n",

      "\n",
      "SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who’s not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...\n",
      "\n",

You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.\n",

      "(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that — that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it’s Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were — significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.\n",

Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they’re ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.\n",

      "But, let’s make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?\n",

      "CLINTON: I will look into it. I don’t know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.\n",
      "\n",

      "This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think it’s a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they’ve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I’ve been in the arena with them time and time again.\n",
      "\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you’ve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but let’s be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.\n",

      "Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.\n",

      "And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they’re paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.\n",

      "Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that’s what I will do.\n",

But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top — his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting.

Maybe I shouldn’t have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn’t get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "(CROSSTALK)\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders’s views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can’t stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.\n",
      "\n",
      "SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience — hat is not arguable — in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I know from my own experience that you’ve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I’ll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "SANDERS: Well...\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you’re right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. They’re Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.\n",

      "So please don’t suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don’t. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary — and you can correct me if I’m wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.\n",

The results were too close not to do a complete audit.”\n",

In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw — there may have been a new one — last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.

      "[' Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.\\nBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.\\nI believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not making promises that I cannot keep.\\n', ' Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now on the path to achieving it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.\\nI also believe in affordable college, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just enough about what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.\\nAnd of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I intend to do.\\n', ' If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)\\nThe Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.\\nI am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.\\n', ' Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard Senator Sanders comments, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really caused me to wonder who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.\\n', ' ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Defense Fund.\\nSo, again...\\n', ' ... I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always stood.\\nAnd, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we ought to be celebrating. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.\\n', ' You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.\\nCLINTON: And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.\\nAnd I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked with me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what I will do.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make progress together when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president.\\n', ' Well, look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)\\nPeople support me because they know me. They know my life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.\\n', ' I am not going to make promises I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON', ' And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of that.\\nCLINTON: So I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...\\n', ' ... in recent weeks, and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk...\\n... let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about about the issues. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about the issues that divide us.\\n', ' And let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s...\\nCLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.\\n', ' I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.\\nCLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.\\n', ' And so \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about issues.\\nWell, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.\\n', ' Well, you know, Senator, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t...\\n', ' ... I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.\\nBut while we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about votes, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.\\nSo I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do as Democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what this election should be about.\\n', ' On the issue of Wall Street.\\nLast night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they offered.\\nHave you been too dismissive of voters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?\\nCLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I left the secretary of State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.\\nBut what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.\\nI called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.\\nAnd why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.\\nSo I do want people to know that, and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.\\n', ' If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.\\nYou know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.\\n', ' Look we have a law \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, you know, I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I appreciate the senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.\\nBut that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.\\nYou know, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just fight the last war. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.\\n', ' I will look into it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.\\nI want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health. Now, if all we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing the big oil companies. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing other big energy companies. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.\\n', ' Well, I think what the president understands, and what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.\\nBut we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.\\nAnd I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing the fighting. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing the support and enabling.\\nAnd I also think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.\\nSo as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep \\xe2\\x80\\x94 try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re describing requires considerably more of Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?\\nCLINTON: No. I mean, of course that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a theoretical question, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what it would be for, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.\\nI support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what the president is doing.\\n', ' If I could \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if I could...\\nCLINTON: ... respectfully add \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...\\n', ' Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.\\n', ' A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON', ' Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.\\nThey are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.\\nIf we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we should. I certainly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.\\n', ' Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let me correct the record.\\n', ' As I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERSThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the way it works.\\n', ' ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly the right...\\nCLINTON: ... And, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.\\n', ' I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talked to Secretary Carter, but here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I would think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.\\nAnd, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.\\nBut, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.\\nWe know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually contributing more to their own defense.\\n', ' Well, first of all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong with the V.A.\\nBut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.\\nI will fight that as hard as I can. I think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.\\n', ' Whatever they decide to do, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine.\\nCLINTON: All right.\\n', ' I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.\\nAnd I say that with great \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll work together.\\nBut what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been vetted. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly anything you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about me. And I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.\\nSo, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.\\nAnd I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m prepared to...\\n', ' Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.\\nI agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.\\n', ' I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a security review about me, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.\\n', ' Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.\\nI absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.\\n', ' You know, Chuck, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.\\nI waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.\\nNow I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way the global economy works.\\nBut we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the trade agreement that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m interested in.\\nI did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.\\n', ' Well, I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept that premise, Chuck. I think that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got so much business we have to do. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve talked a lot tonight about what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re against \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re against income inequality. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re against the abuses of powerful interests. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re against a lot of things.\\nI want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.\\n', ' The answer to both of those is no. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work, and be absolutely clear we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of what doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\nAnd when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not appropriate to say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get rid of this, get rid of that\\xe2\\x80\\x9d until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.\\nBut we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to get done, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I need your help, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something you care about, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n', ' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got people with you every step of the way. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want to do.\\n', ' I never said that.\\n', ' Look \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nCLINTON: Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certainly going to unite the party, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.\\n', ' That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\n', ' Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.\\nSo I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.\\n']\n"
